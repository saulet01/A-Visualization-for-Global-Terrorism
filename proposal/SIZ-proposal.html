<h2>Background and Motivation</h2>

<p>
    In the beginning of the project, we have chosen NBA datasets to work with. However, on Friday, March 15th, 2019,
    there was a devastating terror attack on two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, where 55 people were killed and
    50 others were wounded. After being exposed to related videos and photos, we were very upset and devastated, and
    would like to work with global terrorism attack datasets to help provide a deeper insight into the different aspects
    of global terrorism in modern society, spanning from 1970 to 2017, especially since terrorism has unfortunately
    gained much more media attention as of late. As these events have been painfully recent, we believe that it is
    important to be aware of the circumstances surrounding terrorism and how it impacts the world on a global scale,
    while at the same time being careful to not promote biases and to remain rational in regards to these events.

<h2>Project Objectives</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Where did terrorist attacks happen most frequently within this time frame? This would give an overview on how
        severe the terrorist problem is in certain areas.
    </li>
    <li>How frequent do terrorist attacks happen in a certain region? This would also show severity of the problem.</li>
    <li>How many people were involved? Perpetrators? Victims? This would show the magnitude of each attack and how
        widespread the damage was in context to the local population.
    </li>
    <li>Who or what was targeted in these attacks? Who carried out these attacks? This question would give a broader
        general overview on who was involved.
    </li>
</ol>

<h2>Data</h2>
<p>We found the dataset we need on Kaggle. It contains information on more than 180.000 terrorist attacks that have
    occurred between 1970 and 2017. It’s an comprehensive dataset that contains more than 135 columns. We believe this
    dataset provides great flexibility in terms of visualizing time series, and geospatial dimensions of terrorist
    attacks.
</p>
<h3>Data Processing</h3>
<p>
    We expect to do a decent amount of data cleanup to keep the columns we need, and aggregate necessary data to extract
    information we need. There is also formatting to consider, depending on the type of chart being used. Therefore, we plan to deal with data cleanup in Python and use pandas,
    matplotlib.

<h2>Visualization Design</h2>
<h3>Must-Have Features:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some representation of geospatial location, AKA some form of map perspective to show locations where attacks
        took place.
    </li>
    <li>A select feature that would show more specific information to each attack.
    </li>
    <li>Data filtering to isolate and show specific types of attacks or different facets of information more clearly.
    </li>
</ol>
<h3>Optional Features:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Additional tooltips to show more detailed information without having to specifically select something
    </li>
    <li>Additional legends to help clarify what is being displayed
    </li>
    <li>Perhaps a zooming feature on the map that can zoom in and show greater specifics for each city or village.
    </li>
    <li>Other features that may be readily available and feasible should additional related d3-libraries be found.</li>

<p>
    Generally, we plan to split the programming 3 ways:
    Isabelle: Data wrangling
    Saulet: Design
    Zhikai: Implementation
</p>
<p>
    However, there will most likely be overlapping coding responsibilities as one leads into the other, and since the
    implementation itself may be quite labor intensive. We also plan to split the additional non-programming work
    evenly.
